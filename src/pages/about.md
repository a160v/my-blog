# My Story: A Wildcard's Journey

Let me tell you my story. It's not linear, and it doesn't fit into a single job title. But it makes perfect sense once you understand what drives me: diving headfirst into complex problems at the intersection of technology, policy, and international coordination.

## The Foundation

I started at **Sciences Po Paris**, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences and Humanities on the **Dijon campus** (2014-2017) focusing on **Central and Eastern European Studies**. The curriculum gave me a solid grounding in law, economics, history, political science, and sociology: learning to look at problems from a multidisciplinary angle.

In my third year, while classmates headed to London or Brussels, I went to **Nanjing University in China** to study Modern Chinese Culture and language, even volunteering as an English teacher with AIESEC. This was a real cultural shock, but in a positive way.

I continued at **Sciences Po Paris** for my **Master of Arts in International Public Management** (2017-2019), gaining deep knowledge of policy issues across international, national, and local levels, and learning to design, implement, and analyse policies from diverse expert perspectives. I served as **Event Manager at Young European Federalists (JEF)**, already blending policy advocacy with practical organisation.

## The Entrepreneurial Detour

After my master's, I faced a challenge: I wasn't an EU citizen yet, so breaking into Brussels wasn't straightforward. Instead, I pursued digital entrepreneurship, enrolling in the **_Diplôme Universitaire Étudiant Entrepreneur_ at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord** (2019-2020) while working at **Fempo**, a fashion e-commerce startup in Paris, as **IT Project Coordinator**. I deployed their **Odoo ERP system**, managing everything from defining business processes to training users.

By late 2019, I moved to Berlin to found my own startup. But plans change—when things didn't materialise as expected, I adapted quickly and joined **Gorillas Technologies GmbH** in December 2020.

## Berlin: Thriving in Chaos

At **Gorillas**, I started as **IT Project Coordinator**, managing the deployment of an **Odoo ERP system** across twenty-plus dark stores in three countries. I coordinated two external agencies, managed an eighty-thousand-euro budget, and kept 120 users aligned across technical and business teams.

By April 2021, I became **Product Operations Manager**—my element. The company was expanding internationally at breakneck speed, and I became the person who made it work. I conducted twenty-five interviews to map global supply chain processes, standardised operations, and coordinated product rollouts across **multiple EU and non-EU countries** (UK, US).

My key achievement? Streamlining infrastructure development for country launches, **reducing time from eight weeks to four weeks**—a fifty percent improvement. I constantly travelled to support launches, coordinated between headquarters directors, regional teams, and product developers, and maintained monthly on-call activity with DevOps.

This taught me something fundamental: **I thrive in chaos**. I'm at my best coordinating multiple stakeholders across countries and functions, translating complex requirements into clear guidance, solving problems without precedent.

I briefly worked at **Arive GmbH** (April-September 2022) as **Product Manager**, even designing a mobile-first web app in digital healthcare while coordinating a team of five and managing KPIs for senior leadership.

## Becoming Bilingual in Policy and Code

By 2023, I wanted to understand technology from a developer's perspective. So I enrolled in a **nine-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp at Le Wagon in Zurich**, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, SQL, Ruby on Rails, and modern web development. This wasn't career change—it was becoming truly bilingual in policy and technology.

This knowledge immediately paid off at **Imperium Code** (February 2023-August 2024), where I worked as **Software Consultant, covering both project management and software development.** I supported international, multi-stakeholder projects in highly regulated digital environments, translating regulatory requirements into technical solutions, coordinating across technical and non-technical teams, and managing everything from feasibility assessment to deployment.

The standout project? Contributing to research on **Article 40 of the Digital Services Act**, supporting data access for academic scrutiny of platform governance through the **Meta Content Library and API** on behalf of a partner American university. This required understanding EU digital regulation, working with platform APIs, coordinating between American and European institutions, and translating between regulatory language and technical specifications.

## Coming Full Circle

By 2024, I had an unusual combination: policy education from Sciences Po, entrepreneurship training, operational experience from Berlin startups, technical skills from coding, and deep exposure to EU digital regulation. Time to bring it together.

I enrolled in the **Master of Arts in European Transformation and Integration at the College of Europe** in Tirana, Albania (September 2024-June 2025), focusing my thesis on **Digital Transformation of Public Administration in Albania**. This adds analytical depth and institutional knowledge to my practical experience, deepening my understanding of EU governance structures, legislative processes, and political dynamics shaping digital policy.

## What I Bring

I've built expertise in **EU governance and legislative processes**, particularly **EU digital policy**. I excel at **policy monitoring and analysis**, synthesising complex regulatory frameworks into clear insights. I'm skilled at **stakeholder coordination in multi-actor and multicultural environments**—whether coordinating nine-country rollouts, bridging technical and policy teams, or facilitating transatlantic institutional communication.

Most importantly, I master **clear written communication**—translating technical and policy complexity into accessible language for diverse audiences, from warehouse workers to C-suite executives.

I'm native in **Italian,** Albanian, and Macedonian, bilingual (C2) in **English and French**, fluent (B1) in **Spanish**, with working knowledge of German and Chinese (A2).

## What This All Means

I thrive at the intersection of **technology, policy, and international coordination**. I'm at my best with complex, ambiguous problems requiring simultaneous understanding of multiple domains—translating between technical teams and policy stakeholders, coordinating implementation across regulatory environments, turning abstract requirements into concrete solutions.

When citizenship constraints blocked my original Brussels path, I found another route through entrepreneurship and technology. When startup plans didn't materialise, I pivoted immediately. Each detour added another dimension to my skill set.

I'm not the world's leading expert in any single narrow domain. But I'm very good at a wide range of things, and exceptional at combining them to solve problems that don't fit neat categories. I get things done in uncertain, fast-changing environments where the rulebook is still being written.

That's my story. It's not linear, doesn't fit one job title, and probably looks chaotic from outside. But from inside, it makes perfect sense. **I'm a wildcard, and being hard to categorise is my greatest strength.**
