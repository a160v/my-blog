You know that person on the team who seems to just... _handle_ things? The one who volunteers to jump head-first into a problem nobody else has experience with, just to get it solved?

Hi, I'm **Aleks**. And I'm a **Wildcard**.

Technically, my CVs say things like "EU Public Policy Analyst", "IT Project Manager", or "Software Consultant". But if you look closer, you’ll see the pattern of a "WTF Officer" (cit.) in the making. I thrive in the chaos of the unknown, bridging the gap between rigid policy frameworks and the fast-paced world of digital transformation.

## The "Jack of All Trades" Origin Story

My journey isn't a straight line—it’s a web of connections. I started in **International Public Management** at **Sciences Po Paris**, diving deep into the complexities of public policy and international relations. But understanding the _theory_ of how the world works wasn't enough; I wanted to build the tools that shape it.

So, naturally, I did what any policy wonk would do: I joined a **Coding Bootcamp** in Zurich.

Now, I speak five languages (English, French, Italian, Albanian, and Macedonian) and can write code in a few more (Ruby, JavaScript, Python). I don't just translate languages; I translate _concepts_—turning complex regulatory requirements into actionable code, and explaining technical limitations to policy-makers without making their eyes glaze over.

## Solving Problems, One "WTF" at a Time

My career has been defined by jumping into the deep end:

- **At Gorillas Technologies:** I didn't just "manage operations." I helped orchestrate an international expansion across EU and non-EU markets. From mapping process requirements to creating the "instruction manual" for our national teams, I was the person making sure the chaos of hyper-growth didn't break us.

- **At Imperium Code:** I worked as a **Software Consultant**, but my role was really "Translator-in-Chief." I supported the implementation of Article 40 of the **Digital Services Act**, helping academic researchers scrutinize platform governance. It was the perfect storm of my skills: highly regulated environments, complex tech stacks, and a need for clear, structured communication.

## Why Hire a Wildcard?

I’m not a specialized tool you use for one specific task. I’m the person you call when you have a problem that doesn't fit a job description.

- **Need to make sense of a new EU digital policy?** I’m on it.
- **Need to operationalize that policy into a software project plan?** Done.
- **Need someone to coordinate diverse stakeholders who speak different languages (literally and professionally)?** That’s my Tuesday.

I don't produce masterpieces on the first try, but I produce _solutions_. I fill the gaps, fight the fires, and connect the dots until the path forward is clear.

## Let's Connect

Currently, I'm analyzing the digital transformation of public administration for my Master's thesis at the **College of Europe**. But I'm always looking for the next "impossible" problem to solve.
